# SQL_Project

## SQL_Project: Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze data from a sales records database for scale model cars and extract information for decision-making.
We are trying to answer the following questions:

* Question 1: Which products should we order more of or less of?

* Question 2: How should we tailor marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviors?

* Question 3: How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?


## Database schema
